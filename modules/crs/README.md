# @math.gl/crs

Proj4-independent coordinate reference system definitions shared by math.gl integrations.

PROJJSON is an OSGeo/PROJ specification, not an independently published OGC or ISO standard. It
is designed as a lossless JSON encoding of OGC WKT2:2019 / ISO 19162:2019 and is referenced by OGC
standards. This package uses strict PROJJSON v0.7 as its semantic CRS object model. Authority codes,
PROJ strings, WKT2, WKT1, and vendor WKT dialects remain string serializations.

```ts
import type {CRSDefinition, PROJJSONCRS} from '@math.gl/crs';

const authorityCode: CRSDefinition = 'EPSG:4326';
const projString: CRSDefinition = '+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs';
const projjson: PROJJSONCRS = {
  type: 'GeographicCRS',
  name: 'WGS 84',
  datum: {
    name: 'World Geodetic System 1984',
    ellipsoid: {
      name: 'WGS 84',
      semi_major_axis: 6378137,
      inverse_flattening: 298.257223563
    }
  }
};
```

The official PROJJSON v0.7 JSON Schema is vendored unchanged under its MIT license and exported as
`@math.gl/crs/projjson.schema.json`. It is the source of truth for the checked-in generated
TypeScript declarations. This package has no runtime dependencies and does not include a parser,
converter, runtime validator, or Zod schema.
