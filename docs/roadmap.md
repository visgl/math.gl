# Roadmap

Some of the high-level goals for future and past versions

## v.Next

- Geometry primitives (spheres, cubes etc)
- ...

## v4.0

- Support ES modules
- Fork gl-matrix (because they are moving to 32 bit precision which is too low for geospatial use cases, and also gl-matrix is not merging the ES module exports we need for wide compatibility).

# v3.6

- Full typescript support
